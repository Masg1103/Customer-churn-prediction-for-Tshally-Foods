## Tshally Foods Limited Product Prediction Model

### Overview
Welcome to the Tshally Foods Limited Product Prediction Model repository! This project aims to develop a predictive model using classical machine learning algorithms to forecast product demand for Tshally Foods Limited.

### Dataset
The dataset contains historical sales data for Tshally Foods Limited products, including Tshally Oatmeal (1kg, 2kg, 5kg), Tshally Oat Porridge (1kg), Tshally Plantain Chips, Tshally Garri, Tshally Fonio, and Tshally Bambara Flour.

### Approach
We'll preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and train various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to predict product demand accurately.

### Evaluation
We'll evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, f1-score, precision, accuracy and recall. Cross-validation techniques will ensure robustness and generalizability.
